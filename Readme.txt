Attached below is a dataset which includes more than 40,000 observations of international
football matches that have taken place between 1872-2020.

Data given here does not include female matches or olympic matches and strictly includes FIFA
matches and friendly matches conducted under FIFA patronage.
The data dictionary of the dataset can be given below
● date - date of the match
● home_team - the name of the home team
● away_team - the name of the away team
● home_score - full-time home team score including extra time, not including
penalty-shootouts
● away_score - full-time away team score including extra time, not including
penalty-shootouts
● tournament - the name of the tournament
● city - the name of the city/town/administrative unit where the match was played
● country - the name of the country where the match was played
● neutral - TRUE/FALSE column indicating whether the match was played at a neutral
venue
Using the dataset and the knowledge you have gathered so far, provide a Jupyter notebook
which answers the following questions.
1) What is the impact hosting a major tournament helps a country's chances in winning the
most number of matches within the said tournament?
2) What is the most successful(number of matches played against number of wins) team of
all time and is there a specific period(era) that was dominated by teams?
3) As per the guidelines of FIFA, the next world cup is to be hosted in Qatar in 2022.
a) Define a ML algorithm to find the team that would be most successful(highest
number of wins) in this event.
b) If the 1st four opponents of England in the said world cup are Brazil, Uruguay,
France and Germany define using the above ML algorithm what are the chances
of England winning those matches.
c) If the same four matches above were played in England (basically, imagine the
2022 world cup is hosted in England rather than Qatar) what would be the
chances of England winning those matches.
